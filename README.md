## Project Overview
A web-based application designed to help local communities share events (based in four areas: Sports, Health, Education, Arts&Culture), resources and announcements through a centralised platform.

The project focuses on backend logic, database integration and clean software structure, simulating a real-world community platform.

- Git & GitHub

## Key Features
- User-friendly interface to browse and submit community posts
- Database-backed CRUD operations
- Structured backend logic following OOP principles
- Separation between application logic and data layer

## What I Learned
- Designing and implementing a backend-driven application
- Working with relational databases and SQL queries
- Applying Object-Oriented Programming in a real project
- Writing maintainable and structured code

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the main application file
4. Access the application locally via browser

## Future Improvements
- User authentication
- Role-based access
- Improved UI/UX
